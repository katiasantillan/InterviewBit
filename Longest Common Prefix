"""
Given the array of strings A, 
you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.

Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 
and S2.

For Example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".
